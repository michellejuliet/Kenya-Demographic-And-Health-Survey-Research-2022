2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare the data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and ensuring consistency.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct descriptive analysis to understand the overall characteristics of the population and identify 
  any initial trends or patterns.
4. Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques to analyze relationships between variables, identify significant factors, and draw   conclusions.
5. Data Visualization: Present the analyzed data using charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations to communicate the findings   effectively.
   
# Expected Outputs:

1. A comprehensive report summarizing the demographic trends, socio-economic indicators, and key findings from the analysis.
2. Visual representations, including graphs and charts, to illustrate the patterns and insights discovered.
3. Recommendations based on the findings to address specific issues or leverage opportunities indicated by the data.
   
# Partners:

While this research project is envisioned as an independent effort, collaboration with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics or other relevant organizations may provide additional support, guidance, and access to data sources. However, for the purpose of a personal portfolio, the research project can be completed individually, demonstrating my skills as a junior data analyst or intern.

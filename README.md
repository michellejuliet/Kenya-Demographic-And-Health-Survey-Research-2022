Project Question: The research project aims to analyze the demographic data of Kenya for the year 2022 and draw meaningful insights to understand population trends, socio-economic indicators, and other relevant factors.

Objectives:

Gather and process the Kenya demographic data for 2022.
Analyze the population distribution across different regions, age groups, and gender.
Explore socio-economic indicators such as education, employment, income, and housing.

Data Collection: Obtain the Kenya demographic data for 2022 from reliable sources, such as the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics or relevant government agencies.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare the data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and ensuring consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct descriptive analysis to understand the overall characteristics of the population and identify any initial trends or patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques to analyze relationships between variables, identify significant factors, and draw conclusions.
Data Visualization: Present the analyzed data using charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
Expected Outputs:

A comprehensive report summarizing the demographic trends, socio-economic indicators, and key findings from the analysis.
Visual representations, including graphs and charts, to illustrate the patterns and insights discovered.
Recommendations based on the findings to address specific issues or leverage opportunities indicated by the data.
Partners:
While this research project is envisioned as an independent effort, collaboration with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics or other relevant organizations may provide additional support, guidance, and access to data sources. However, for the purpose of a personal portfolio, the research project can be completed individually, demonstrating my skills as a junior data analyst or intern.
